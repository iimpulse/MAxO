# Medical Action Ontology (MAXO)


The Medical Action Ontology (MAxO) provides a broad view of medical actions and includes terms for medical procedures, interventions, therapies, treatments, and recommendations.

### MAxO Curation

- DOSDP templates are the prefered method to add terms to MAxO as it coordinates term labels, textual definitions, and logical definitions. Manual and or Robot templates may be used, but please look first to see if DOSDP templates are in use. To learn more about how to develop and use DOSDP templates, see  [MAxOs DOSDP templates](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/MAxO/tree/master/src/patterns) wiki or [OBO DOSDP tutorials ](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/tutorial/dosdp-overview/) for how to construct these).

- Manual additions via Protege
    
- ROBOT templates (see [MAxO ROBOT templates ](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/MAxO/tree/master/src/templates


### MAxO Governance

Request terms:

**GitHub tickets**
        - To request, edit, or correct a term,  create a MAxO [GitHub ticket](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/MAxO/issues). 
        - The more detail, including definition, synonyms, and axiomatization, the quicker the term will be added. 
        - Even better, add additional terms and children terms that are missing.
        - Overachiever? Group terms that have similarities might be grouped into (new) DOSDP patterns
**Pull requests**
    - If you are familiar with GitHub PRs and Protege, DOSDP, or ROBOT templates, then a person may create a pull request with your term.
    - PLEASE NOTE: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">DOSDP patterns</span>
        - Some terms are grouped together and created by DOSDP patterns 
        - If you know how to use DOSDP patterns, you can suggest adding a new pattern [HERE](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/MAxO/tree/master/src/patterns/dosdp-patterns) or a new term [HERE](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/MAxO/tree/master/src/patterns/data/manual).
    - For MAxO IDs: If unsure, leave blank or obtain from [HERE](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/MAxO/blob/master/src/patterns/data/todo/MAXO_availableIDs.txt)  (and then delete to signify using the ID) or request IDs from @LCCarmody.  
        - If still unsure, just use an ID number and the IDs will be changed upon PR review.
    - Tag @LCCarmody for review.
